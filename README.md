# Cybersecurity-Seminars-TUCN
Work from Cybersecurity Seminars program funded by Google.org
We've worked mostly on attacks and defense protocols of IoT and CPS.
The themes that we've done are "Integration and security of an industrial system in IoT and CPS", "Cryptographic optimization" which would reffer to optimizing AES implementations of Arduino, RSA Cryptography on a Raspberry Pi, ELGamal Cryptography on Rapsberry Pi, Secure communication between two devices and so on, "Machine Learning pipeline attacks for IoT and CPS", "Wireless networks security in IoT and CPS", "Security testing with Raspberry Pi and Kali Linux", "SQLInjections".
